# Advent Of Code - 2021 - In Time ‚è≤Ô∏è
Advent of code 3rd attempt (2021) - https://adventofcode.com/

Puzzles solved while they were being published

## Motivation üöÇ

I had previously done two Advent of Code's, [Advent of Code 2020][Advent of Code 2020] and [Advent of Code 2019][Advent of Code 2019], however both of these were solved in my free time quite a while after they were published. Since my first attempt at AOC, I wanted to attempt to solve them while they were being published, on time, and challenge myself to complete the puzzles also in time.

In previous attempts there was no motivation to complete them in time, necessarily one by day, since all the puzzles were already solved and most people had already faced them.

## Why Rust ü¶Ä

One of the previous attempts allowed me to get into Rust. Although programming with Rust takes me quite a bit more time than with other high level languages, like Python, Rust makes me code better and is relatively confortable to code in. In the mentioned attempt I also got the feeling that although I got familar with Rust and its functioning, there were some aspects of it that I was still obllivious to.

By using a language that I knew the basics of but that I still could improve on, it would allow me to improve in some aspect while solving the puzzles but at the same time not be delayed by the language itself, since completing the callenges in time was one of my objectives.

## Methodology ‚úç

Not to much to comment on regarding as to methodology. I made no effort to be awake and ready to solve the puzzles when they were made available, but I did make the effort to allocate some time everyday to the resolution of the puzzles, ypically on the morning.

Some puzzles took me a bit more time to solve. If I was unable to solve the puzzle and a good nights rest did not aid in getting inspiration to its resolution, which happened once, I skipped it. I typically do not like skipping puzzles, since the process of learning might help in future endeavours, however, since I was trying to compelte them in time, by the end of 25th, I had no other option.

Another thing important to note is that although winning some points would be good, coding fast in not my style, I like to use struct or object like structures to solve the problem and to make it able of solving more general cases and not simply the particular one that I am facing.

## Things to keep in mind next time üôä

Next time I try to complete the Advent of Code, I would like to change a few things:

1. Maybe even create a private scoreboard with a few people. The sense of competition tends to motivate work, as long as this competition is friendly (and local because of time zones).
2. Try to write a bit about the challenge and what I felt about it. What was the hardest, easiest, the challenge, how I overcame, etc. Most of the challenges are really interesting and lead to good observations and conclusions, but most of them leave my head soon after completing, so leaving it to the end is not a good choice.
3. Despite coding fast not being particularly my fort√© or to my liking, I would llike to attempt at getting some points.

## What comes next üîÆ

Well, what comes next... I would like first and foremost to keep on solving previous years of Advent of Code, until I have completed all the years. Additionally, I would love to gain knowledge regarding how to make fun, cool and exciting visualizations from the resolution of puzzles. Although the visual aspect of coding is not my main pursue, they are so fun to watch online from the community of AOC that I would like to contibute as well or at least learn how to propperly and relatively easily develop visualizations.

## Acknowledgments ü§ó

Such a fun assortment of challenges developed by [Eric Wastl][Eric Wastl Webpage]. What made these challenges so interesting was the progression in them. In the begining most of them are straight forward, easy enough to implement, more towards the end some of them are quite difficult, not of implementing but more of developing something that solves it in a reasonable amount of time and the puzzle that comes after one of these that are harder are typically quite easy which renovates the energy and will to solve more of them.

The easter eggs which are invisible are quite fun as well, thanks.
